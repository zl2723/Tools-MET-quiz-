Purpose of the project 
The project will create a user-interactive quiz on different objects on display in the Metropolitan Museum with randomly generated multiple-choice questions. 

Output
The output will be a GUI window which generates the image of an object on each page and a related multiple-choice question. The user will be able to choose from 4 answers and be told if the choice is correct or not and the correct answer if answered wrongly. The program will also keep track of the userâ€™s performance, in terms of number of correctly answered questions out of the total number of questions.
The questions can be about the artist, time period, art genre, department, etc.
